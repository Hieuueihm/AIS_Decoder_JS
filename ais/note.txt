Position messages
AIS position messages mostly broadcast information about a vessel’s physical location and motion.

This includes a vessel’s MMSI number, longitude, latitude, rate of turn, speed, true heading, and other parameters.

Spire offers the following position messages to customers:

Messages 1, 2, and 3 from Class A vessels
Message 4 from base stations
Message 18 from Class B vessels
Message 27 from Class A or B vessels (for long-range applications)
The Nominal Reporting Interval for Class A and B vessels traveling at most 3 knots and 2 knots respectively, or when Anchored/Moored, 
is a broadcast every 3 minutes.


Static messages
AIS static messages mostly broadcast information about vessel characteristics that should remain (relatively) static over the during of their voyage.

This includes a vessel’s MMSI number, AIS version number, IMO number, call sign, name, type of ship/cargo, ship dimensions, destination, and other parameters.

Spire offers the following static messages to customers:

Message 5 from Class A vessels
Message 24 from Class B vessels
The Nominal Reporting Interval for both Class A and B vessels
 is a broadcast static message every 6 minutes, when an information change has been made, or upon request.

Position Report For Long-Range Applications

In normal operation, an AIS transceiver will broadcast a position report (type 1, 2, or 3) every 2 to 10 seconds depending on
 the vessel’s speed while underway, and every 3 minutes while the vessel is at anchor and stationary.
